Winput Ver. 1.21 (c) 2007-2008, Horst Schaeffer
-----------------------------------------------

Winput offers an input window to get a user's input string for batch processing.
Winput supports multiline prompt text and automatic window sizing. 

Syntax:  
    Winput OutputString PromptString [InitialString] [Options]  [ > File ]

The OutputString (enclosed in double quote marks) must include the token $input, which will be replaced by the actual input string. To catch the input, the output must be redirected to a file.

Example:
    Winput "set name=$input" "Please enter your name" /upper > temp.bat 
    if not errorlevel 1 call temp.bat

This will send a SET statement to the file temp.bat (or .cmd), and after you execute this BAT file, you will have the input string in the environmental variable %name%.

You can produce and execute any other command this way, or you can simply write the input string to a file. 

Arguments:
    OutputString    must include the token "$input"; string will be sent to STDOUT 
    PromptString    text message above input field; line feeds by caret character ("^") 
    InitialString   for the input field (optional) 

Options:
    /upper     case
    /lower     case
    /num       only numbers (0..9) allowed 
    /pass      input will not be visible (that's all!)
    /timeout:n timeout after n seconds, returning the initial string
               (the colon is mandatory; no space!)
               Note: the timer will be cancelled on any input or window resizing.
    /OEM       the output will be transformed to OEM (DOS) characters 
               Note that the command line is assumed OEM, if extended chars are used;
               pls. use appropriate editor.

Keyboard:   
    Enter or Escape accepted

Errorlevel:
      0: OK button was clicked (though the string may be empty) 
      1: Cancel or window closed without action 
    255: Syntax error (message box) 

Notes: 
------
The string parameters must be enclosed in double quote marks. 
If you need double quote marks inside the PromptString or OutputString, 
use two single quote marks (''), which will be replaced. 

Case ignored for the options and the $input token. 
All parameters and options must be separated by blank space (no commas!).

The output string comes without terminating CR+LF, however, you can use the
caret character (^) to append or insert CRLF. 

Another example:
----------------
    Winput "md ''$input''" "New directory name:" /oem > temp.bat 
    if not errorlevel 1 call temp.bat
