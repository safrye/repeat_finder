Wprompt - Batch Tool Ver. 2.2 (c) 2003-2009, Horst Schaeffer
------------------------------------------------------------

Wprompt displays a prompt box with up to 3 standard buttons, and returns 
an Errorlevel value to check the selected button in batch files. 
The prompt box remains "on top" in case the user clicks into another window. 
The box will be displayed in the middle of the console window, however, 
if the console is minimized, the box will show in the mniddle of the desktop. 

Syntax: Wprompt "Title" "Text" Buttons [Default[:TimeOut]] [Icon]

*  Title (in double quote marks) will show in the title bar of the window.

*  Text (in double quote marks) is the message for the user
   A line feed can be inserted with the caret symbol (^).

*  Buttons are specified by the following keywords (case ignored):
        Ok                (as Pause repacement)
        OkCancel                 
        YesNo
        YesNoCancel

*  Default is the number of the default button 1..3 
   If omitted or invalid, the default button is 1.
   Optional TimeOut (seconds), separated by a colon, e.g.: 2:10
   The time-out feature requires a non-empty title. 
   
*  Icon (optional, case ignored) with associated sound:
        i       Info 
        !       Exclamation
        ?       Question
        x       Critical Error

Parameters must be separated by space(s), no commas!

The Exit Code (Errorlevel) is 1..3 according to the selected button number. 
On timeout the preset default button number is returned. 

Note that in batch files "If Errorlevel 2" means: 
"If the Exit Code is equal to or greater than 2". 

Example: 
        Wprompt "Error" "Continue Search?" YesNo 2 ? 
        if not errorlevel 2 goto Continue
        echo You have cancelled the search
        goto END 

Syntax errors will produce a syntax message box, and return Exit Code 255.
Once you tested the command sucessfully, this error will not occur,
so you need not check it in your batch file.
